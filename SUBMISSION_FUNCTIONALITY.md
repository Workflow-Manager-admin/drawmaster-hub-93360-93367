# Submission Functionality Implementation

This document provides an overview of the submission functionality implemented for the DrawMaster Hub application.

## Backend Implementation

We've implemented the following backend features to support contest submissions:

1. **File Upload Support**
   - Added multer middleware for handling file uploads
   - Set up static file serving for uploaded images
   - Created an uploads directory for storing submission images

2. **API Endpoints**
   - GET `/api/submissions` - Get user's submissions or all submissions (admin)
   - GET `/api/submissions/:id` - Get a specific submission by ID
   - POST `/api/submissions` - Create a new submission with file upload support
   - PUT `/api/submissions/:id` - Update an existing submission
   - DELETE `/api/submissions/:id` - Delete a submission
   - GET `/api/submissions/contest/:contestId` - Get submissions for a specific contest
   - PUT `/api/submissions/:id/rate` - Rate a submission

## Frontend Implementation

We've created the following React components and services to support the submission functionality:

1. **Context & API**
   - `SubmissionContext` - Provides state management and API calls for submissions
   - Updated API utilities to handle multipart/form-data uploads

2. **Components**
   - `SubmissionForm` - For creating and editing submissions with image upload
   - `SubmissionList` - For displaying lists of submissions with filters
   - `SubmissionDetail` - For viewing detailed information about a submission

3. **Integration**
   - Added submission routes to the MainContainer
   - Enhanced UserDashboard with submission data
   - Connected submission creation to ContestDetail component
   - Added SubmissionContext provider to the application

## Features Implemented

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images for their contest submissions
- **Submission Management**: Users can create, view, edit, and delete their submissions
- **Submission Listing**: Users can view their submissions and submissions by contest
- **Submission Details**: Detailed view of a submission with image and metadata
- **Submission Rating**: Users can rate other users' submissions (for completed contests)
- **Dashboard Integration**: User dashboard shows submission activity and recent submissions

## Security Features

- Authentication required for submission creation, editing, and deletion
- Authorization checks to ensure users can only edit/delete their own submissions
- Admin privileges for managing all submissions
- File validation for uploaded images (type and size)
- API route protection for all submission operations

## Next Steps
